# Statistics-Multi-Class-Prediction-Obesity-Risk
Multi Class Prediction Obesity Risk report -probability and Statistics

This project is an **individual academic assignment** carried out for the
module **Probability and Statistics**.The study focuses on identifying and predicting **multi-class obesity risk levels**
using **statistical and probability-based analysis** on population data.
Obesity risk is classified into multiple categories such as **Underweight,
Normal Weight, Overweight, and Obesity (Type I, II, III)** using descriptive
and inferential statistical techniques.
## **Aim of the Study**
To analyze population-level data and determine how **lifestyle, demographic,
and health-related factors** influence obesity risk using **statistical methods**.

---

## **Objectives**
- Identify obesity prevalence across different categories  
- Analyze relationships between lifestyle factors and obesity  
- Compare obesity risk between males and females  
- Apply hypothesis testing to evaluate BMI trends  
- Use chi-squared tests to examine associations between categorical variables  
- Present results using statistical tables and visualizations

## **Dataset Information**
- **Dataset Name:** `Dataset-population.csv`
- **Source:** Kaggle – Multi-Class Prediction Obesity Risk Dataset
- **Type:** Secondary data
- **Observations:** 200 (sampled from 2500 records)
- **Variables:** 17 (Numerical + Categorical)

### Key Variables
- **Numerical:** Age, Height, Weight, BMI, Physical Activity, Water Intake  
- **Categorical:** Gender, Family History, Food Habits, Smoking, Transportation  
- **Target Variable:** `NObeyesdad` (7 obesity classes)

---

## **Methodology**
The analysis was carried out using the following steps:

1. Data understanding and preparation  
2. Descriptive statistical analysis  
3. BMI calculation and categorization  
4. Hypothesis testing using **t-tests**  
5. Association testing using **Chi-Squared tests**  
6. Interpretation of statistical results  

---

## **Statistical Techniques Used**
- Descriptive statistics (Mean, Median, Standard Deviation, Range)  
- Frequency distributions and cross-tabulations  
- Hypothesis testing (t-distribution)  
- Chi-Squared tests for independence  
- Graphical analysis (Pie charts, Histograms, Bar charts)  

---

## **Key Findings**
- Majority of individuals fall into **overweight and obesity categories**  
- **Females showed a higher mean BMI** compared to males  
- **Family history** has a strong association with obesity  
- **High-calorie food consumption** significantly increases obesity risk  
- **Physical inactivity** is common and linked to higher BMI  
- Smoking shows a weak but statistically significant association

## **Tools & Concepts**
- Probability Theory  
- Descriptive & Inferential Statistics  
- BMI Analysis  
- Hypothesis Testing  
- Chi-Squared Association Analysis  

---

## **Limitations**
- Cross-sectional data (cause-effect not confirmed)  
- Dataset sourced from Kaggle  
- Some variables are self-reported  
- Results may not be generalized to all populations  

---

## **Conclusion**
This study confirms that obesity is a **multi-factorial health issue** influenced
by both **modifiable factors** (diet, physical activity) and **non-modifiable
factors** (age, gender, genetics).  
Statistical analysis proves effective in identifying obesity risk patterns and
supports early prevention strategies through data-driven insights.
